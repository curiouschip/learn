## Introduction

{{< figure src="captouch.png" >}}

The capacitive touch panel connects to Pip via the USB connector and allows you to connect the world to Pip. You can touch the capacitive touch pads directly with your fingers, but it's more fun to connect the pads to other conducting objects using the included leads.

## Conductors
Conducting objects are defined as the materials or substances that allow electricity to flow through them. The best conductors are metals, however any water containing object can conduct electricity (e.g. fruits and vegetables, the human body and more). Some examples are shown below.
