# Connecting to Pip

---

You can connect to Pip using any device that is equipped with a browser. Although a computer or laptop is preferable, you can also connect using a tablet with a physical keyboard (we don't recommend using a screen based keyboard for coding).

## Enter Pip's IP address

In order to connect to Pip, you must have already configured Pip's WiFi following the steps outlined in the [Configuring WiFi](/docs/getting-started/configuring-wifi/) section. You should see a WiFi symbol in the top right of the screen and a valid IP address in the top left of the screen.

{{< hint warning >}}
It is important to add the suffix :8080 **after** the IP address to connect to Pip and both devices must be connected to the same network.

## Pip's Home Screen

Once logged on, you will have access to Pip's Home Screen. From this screen, you can edit existing apps and games, or create your own. Further guidance on creating your own apps is given in the **Project Types** section.
