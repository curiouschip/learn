# Connecting to Pip

---

You can connect to Pip using any device that is equipped with a browser. Although a computer or laptop is preferable, you can also connect using a tablet with a physical keyboard (we don't recommend using a screen based keyboard for coding).

---

## Enter Pip's IP address

In order to connect to Pip, both devices should be on the **same network**. Open a new browser window and enter Pip's IP address (shown on the top right corner of Pip's screen), adding the suffix **:8080**

It is important to add the suffix :8080 **after** the IP address to connect to Pip.

## Pip's Home Screen

Once logged on, you will have access to Pip's Home Screen. From this screen, you can edit existing apps and games, or create your own. Further guidance on creating your own apps is given in the **Project Types** section.
