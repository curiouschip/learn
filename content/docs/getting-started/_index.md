## Controllers

Pip's USB controllers are easy to attach and connect to Pip through the USB connectors on either side.

### Connecting Controllers
Simply guide in from the side to connect to USB ports. This may sound a bit silly, but it is possible to insert them into the wrong side, so make sure the directional controller is inserted to the left of the touchscreen and buttons to the right.

### Removing Controllers
Before sliding each controller from the base unit, gently lift the rear edge of the controller to release the unit. You are best doing this one controller at a time, unless you have a third hand to catch Pip, which you probably donâ€™t.
