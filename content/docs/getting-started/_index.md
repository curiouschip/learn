## Controllers

Pip's USB controllers are easy to attach and connect to Pip through the USB connectors on either side.

### Connecting Controllers
Simply guide in from the side to connect to USB ports until you feel them lock in place. There are grooves on the back of Pip that help guide in the controllers

This may sound a bit silly, but it is possible to insert them into the wrong side, so make sure the directional controller is inserted to the left of the touchscreen and buttons to the right.

### Removing Controllers
Before sliding each controller from the base unit, gently lift the rear edge of the controller to release the unit. You are best doing this one controller at a time, unless you have a third hand to catch Pip, which you probably donâ€™t.

### Third Party Controllers
Any USB controller can be used with Pip. Controllers can be attached to the USB connectors on either side and if more than 2 controllers are required, you can attach a USB hub to Pip and play multi-player games.

## MicroSD Card

Pip ships with a MicroSD card already inserted, which boots into our custom software. You can run RetroPie or Raspbian on Pip (some tweaks may be required and there are links in the downloads section).
